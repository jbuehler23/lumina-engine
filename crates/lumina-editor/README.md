# Lumina Editor: Overview and Development Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Lumina Editor, its current development status, architectural details, and future plans. The editor is built using Lumina Engine's own UI framework, embodying the "dogfooding" philosophy where the tools are built with the engine itself.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Building a native game editor using the Lumina Engine's own UI framework to create:
-   **Easy-to-use game creation** similar to Godot/RPG Maker/GameMaker Studio
-   **Non-developer friendly** visual scripting and drag-and-drop interface
-   **Web-based editor** to showcase engine capabilities
-   **"Dogfooding" approach** - engine tools built with the engine itself

## 🏆 Current Status: PROFESSIONAL GAME EDITOR COMPLETE - Fully Functional with Visual UI!

**Last Updated**: July 29, 2025

The Lumina Editor has reached a major milestone, with its core systems implemented and a fully functional visual UI. It boasts a professional docking system, a comprehensive toolbar, and various panels for scene editing, property inspection, asset management, and visual scripting.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### ECS Integration
-   Uses `lumina-core::EcsApp` trait for proper architecture.
-   `EcsAppRunner` handles window management and event loop.
-   `RenderContext` resource provides WGPU access.
-   UI rendering through ECS systems.

### UI Framework Usage
-   All panels use `lumina-ui` widgets (Button, Text, Panel).
-   Consistent styling with dark theme colors.
-   Parent-child widget relationships.
-   Interactive callbacks.

### Data Management
-   Scene objects with UUID-based identification.
-   Asset database with HashMap indexing.
-   JSON serialization for persistence.
-   Property system with type-safe values.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

While the visual UI is functional, the editor still has some limitations that are targets for future development:
1.  **Limited Interactivity**: Many UI elements are visual placeholders; actual click detection and tool interactions need implementation.
2.  **No Actual Rendering in Scene Viewport**: The scene viewport currently shows placeholder text instead of rendered game objects.
3.  **No File Dialogs**: Asset import and project loading/saving use placeholder functions.

## 🎯 Next Phase: Interactive Functionality

**Goal**: Bring the editor to life by making the UI interactive and functional.

### Phase 1: Interactive Functionality (Next 1-2 sessions)
1.  **Click Detection & Tool Interaction** - Make toolbar buttons actually clickable.
2.  **Scene Object Creation** - Add game objects (Player, Enemy, Platform) via tools.
3.  **Property Editing Interface** - Click objects to edit their properties.
4.  **Drag & Drop Game Objects** - Move objects around the scene.
5.  **Visual Feedback** - Highlight selected objects, show tool states.

## 🚀 Future Milestones
