# üéÆ Lumina Engine - Complete Demo Guide

**From Zero to Playable Game in Minutes!**

This guide demonstrates how the new Lumina Engine makes game development as easy as "Scratch for Game Development" using our revolutionary Rust UI framework and visual scripting system.

## üöÄ What We've Built

We've created a **complete game development ecosystem** that transforms game creation from months of coding to minutes of visual design:

### ‚úÖ **Pure Rust UI Framework**
- **No HTML/CSS/JS complexity** - Everything is type-safe Rust
- **WGPU-based rendering** - Modern GPU acceleration  
- **Cross-platform** - Same code runs on desktop, web, and mobile
- **Dogfooding architecture** - Editor built with the engine itself

### ‚úÖ **Visual Script Editor**
- **Node-based programming** - Drag, drop, connect - no coding required
- **20+ pre-built nodes** - Input, movement, collision, sound, logic
- **Real-time execution** - See your game logic running immediately
- **Professional workflow** - Save, load, version control ready

### ‚úÖ **Complete Game Prototype**
- **Player movement** controlled by visual scripts
- **Coin collection** with score tracking
- **Physics simulation** with gravity and collisions
- **Asset system** with sprites and sounds
- **Live debugging** with real-time state inspection

- WebAssembly compilation without code changes
- Professional web interface with modern styling
- Cross-platform UI consistency

**How to run:**
```bash
# Build for web
./scripts/build_web.sh

# Start server
cd deploy
./start_server.sh

# Open browser to:
# http://localhost:3030/rust_ui_demo.html
```

## üé® Visual Script Examples

### **Player Movement Script**
```
[Input: Key 'A' Held] ‚Üí [Move Player Left at 200px/s]
[Input: Key 'D' Held] ‚Üí [Move Player Right at 200px/s]  
[Input: Key 'Space' Pressed] ‚Üí [Set Player Velocity Y to 300]
```

### **Coin Collection Script**
```
[On Collision with 'Player'] ‚Üí [Play Sound: 'coin_pickup.wav']
                              ‚Üì
                             [Add 10 to Score]
                              ‚Üì
                             [Destroy Self]
```

### **Enemy AI Script**
```
[On Update] ‚Üí [Move Towards Player at 50px/s]
[On Timer: 2s] ‚Üí [Spawn Bullet]
              ‚Üí [Play Sound: 'enemy_shoot.wav']
```
